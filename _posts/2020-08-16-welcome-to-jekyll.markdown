This post is the first of many for our blog!

I want to introduce myself. 

My name is Panos (short for Panagiotis) Xynos, and I am the founder and sole owner of Onlyascii Ltd. 

Professionally I am a polyglot software engineer with a dream. 
I always wanted to be active in the field of video games. Onlyascii is allowing me to make my dream come true.

This blog will act as a log of my progress through the field of Game Development, amongst others.

This site will transform over time. For the time being, it is just another Jekyll based website under our GitHub account.

Thank you for your time. See you soon.
